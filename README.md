# PlanetScale Boost Limited Beta

Welcome! If you're reading this, it means you've been invited into the limited beta, and are moments away from trying out PlanetScale Boost for yourself.

In order to get started, head over to the database you're looking to enable PlanetScale Boost with and look for the Boost tap, and join the limited beta:

Once that's done, you can add a query cache instance:

During the limited beta, you'll only be able to add a 4GB cluster:

This will begin the process of creating a PlanetScale Boost cluster in the background, which may take a few minutes. Once that's done, you should see your 4GB cluster available:

At this point, you're ready to get boosting! Follow the directions in our [PlanetScale Boost Documentation]() to find a query from the last 24 hours that's eligible for boosting, and start testing it out.

## Help and Feedback

Our primary channel for support around PlanetScale Boost will be our [Discussion Board](https://github.com/planetscale/boost-beta/discussions) in this Repository. This is where we will be posting updates for any major changes, and where we're asking users to provide feedback or pass along difficulties. If you have any issues, feedback, or just want to say hi - head over there! 

While PlanetScale Boost is in limited beta, we will do what we can to avoid breaking implicit behavior or causing disruptions, but that may not always be possible. We do not recommend using PlanetScale Boost for critical workflows while we are in the limited beta timeframe.
